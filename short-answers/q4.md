# Question

What is an "inline function"? Give an example with your definition.

# Answer

A inline function is an anonynmous function that is written in one line. This can be seen when a variable is equal to the arrow function.
Example of an inline function is:

An inline function is one that is defined, but not initialized or declared, directly in the code where it is needed or within the context of where it is used. It is also called an anonymous function because it is not given a name when defined.

We use them often for callback functions or when we want to immediately execute something. An example would be using an inline function within a method and logging it to the console:

```js
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach((num) => console.log(num)); //1, 2, 3
```
