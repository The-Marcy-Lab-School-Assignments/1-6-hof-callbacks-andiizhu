# Question

What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1, 2, 3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer

What is wrong in the code is the parentheses in `printDouble`. The reason is that forEach is invoking the function of `printDouble` but `printDouble` is not invoking anything.
